      You will have 10 basic multiplication problems to answer, and a limited time to answer each question.
      <br />You will be scored out of these 10 problems. To begin the game, select the time per question you would like,
      then
      press Begin.
      <br />The game will place your cursor in the answer box, you can submit an answer by pressing enter,
      <br />or if time runs out, whatever is in the input box will be submitted. Good luck!
